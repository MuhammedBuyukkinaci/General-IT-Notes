# Designing Machine Learning Systems

# Overview of Machine Learning Systems

1) The book and its sections

2) It is possible to roll out an ML model without training it. Continual learning would be in this category. When data arrives, it will train.

3) Training data and unseen data should come from the same distribution.

4) ML is useful when the cost of a wrong prediction is low.

5) If ML can't solve our problem, we can break the problem into subproblems and apply ML to each subproblem.

6) When you type on your phone, the next word would be predicted via ML. This problem is known as predictive typing.

7) Price optimization is an ML problem happening in flight tickets, accomodation bookings, internet ads, ride sharing. ML based price optimization is mostly usef for businesses that have huge amount of transactions, changing demands and eager customers that can pay dynamic price.

8) Acquiring a new customer is 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an old customer.

9) Some ML problems:

- Support Ticket Classification
- Brand monitoring: Sentiment analysis problem.

10) ML in Research vs ML in production

11) It is crucial for ML engineers to understand requirements from all stakeholders.

12) Ensembling techniques aren't generally used in production due to high latency characteristic.

13) ML is different than traditional SWE. In SWE, data and code are aimed to be separated. Whereas, ML systems are composed of data, code and artifacts generated by data and code.

# Chapter 2. Introduction to Machine Learning Systems Design

1) One of the typical characteristic of a failed ML project is that data scientists focus on model metrics without paying enough attention to business metrics.

2) In CTR(Click Through Rate) and Fraud Detection, model metrics and business metrics align together. Therefore, they are the most popular ML problems.

3) Most ML systems should have the following characteristics:

    - Reliability
    - Scalability
    - Maintainability
    - Adaptability

4) Code, data, and artifacts should be versioned.

5) ML project lifecycle
